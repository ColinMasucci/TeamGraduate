welcome back again it's a pleasure to have you here and on today's menu we are going to do solve problems on proportions and when you are talking about proportions we are referring to either direct proportion or indirect proportion and sometimes a indirect is referred to as inverse proportions so if two quantities are directly proportional then it means if one item is increasing the other one is also increasing and if one item is decreasing the other item is also decreasing so meaning if you find a situation like that then it would mean that they are directly proportional while the opposite is true whereby if one item is increasing and the other one is decreasing then how you relate to them you could say that this item they are investing proportional okay let's start off with the practical problems on proportions the first example we asked a row of 33 centimeter long has a mass of 561 gram what is the mass of 13 centimeter of this rope okay here we can see that we are comparing we are trying to get the mess a certain rope but then we can see that on the first on the first scenario the 36 centimeter long is giving us 560 is weighing 561 gram now at the tenth century obviously here we can see that we are expecting to get a less gram because for a a longer rope it's giving us this one so it means that for a less prefer for a shorter rope we are also expecting to see to get a lower mess so we can tell that this is a direct proportion so let's look at how we solved it so we are equating 33 centimeter is equal to 561 gram so now what is the mass of 18 centimeter so we equate them such that we get the uh uh we equate the unknown mess we call it x right so since this is a directly proportion we just do a cross multiplication and then x times 33 equals 251 561 gram times 13 and then we solve then we should be able to get 221 gram so a 13 centimeter is going to give to weigh 221 as i've explained to say that in this case this shorter the short the short row it was supposed to give us less mess of which we can eventually see that the 221 gram is less or smaller than the 561 then the next question we asked taking one liter to b this was supposed to be a mixed fraction so it is one three over four it is it has to be like that okay taking one liter to view one three over four pins find the number of pins in 12 liters okay we see that these are all liquid that we are comparing so if you are then we can eventually also tell that this is a direct proportion equation so what we solve it to just solve it in a similar way we did for the previous example we then equate 1 liter equals to 1 3 over 4 of which here i just converted the mixed fraction into an improper fraction and then now since it's a direct proportion so 12 liter equals to the unknown value of pins i substitute it with x or i equate it or i represent it with x that is that name i say 12 times i do a cross multiplication you do a cross multiplication and then you say 12 times 7 over 4 equals to x times 1 so x is going to be 12 times 7 7 over 4 of which you should be able to get 21 pins okay the second question says the number of liters in eight pins find the number of letters in eight pins so now remember in the first question they asked us to find the pins now they are asking us to find the letters so we still just use the same similar method of which on on my left hand side here here i have liters and here i have pins so now instead of me putting the x on this side since this one is already given to me as eight i put x on this side the unknown value so you do the cross multiplication then you should be able to say that eight equals to one uh one one of one three over four x and then you find the value of x to be the two over seven which is eventually four point five seven liters because they say give your answer as a decimal you can leave it this this is a fraction it's not a decimal you have to convert it to decimal if you punch on your calculator 32 over 7 it should be able to give you 4.57 liters and then is 410 so first of all we need to determine whether this equation is a direct or indirect how are they relating so we are given to say that 500 repeats the food would remain for 14 days right now how long does the quantity last when the number of rabbits is 420 now the number of rabbits have have decreased right we can see that the number of rabbits then we need to know to now then find out the is the secret we then need to find out are we expecting to get the number of days decreasing also since the number of rabbits have increased but in this case the number of days won't decrease but it would rather increase because imagine mind you mind you if you have more rabbits they will eat up the food within a shorter period of time so the days are going to be less but if you have fewer rabbits then that means they would consume the food for a longer period of time so the number of days are going to increase we are expecting an increase in it in the degree okay here we are x we are expecting an e increase on the right hand side when there is when on the left hand side there is a decrease so hence this equation is going this equation this question is an inversely proportional so what we do uh how we this is how we represent in in indirect proportion like y is inversely proportional to 1 over x so then i need to make it an equation the moment i make it an equation then x this one becomes a certain constant of which i don't know that's why i represented where by k becomes the constant now let's say i've equated my the days to be the y and the rabbits to be x so that i may be able to find the that certain constant so then if i substitute uh y here i substitute the rabbit which is 500 is here i equate it to k over 14 14 is x which is the number of days so i would get k is 500 times 40 so k is 7 000. then i need to go to the question how long does the quantity last when the number of rabbits is 120 so 420 is the rabbits rabbit is equals to y this is y and the k is we have already found it in 7 000 so now i need to get the number of days so the number of days is just going to be i take x to the other side and bring 120 to this side so x is equal to 7 000 divided by 120 of which it is like this how many ribs can be fed for 20 days so now i am looking for why because mind you i've equated my rabbits i have noted denoted them to be to be to be a yeah i've denoted the rabbits to be x yeah how many ribs sorry about it how many rabies can be fed for 20 days so oh yeah but this was supposed to be x so sorry about that let this be y yeah let the days be x and let the rabbits be why it's just a typo so it has to be like that but whichever way whichever way you can you can make your days as why or your your days as x your the constant will still it won't change it will still be the same so the number of repeats when i when i when i say y it was to k over x so x is 20 seven thousand divided by twenty so i should be able to get three hundred and fifty rabbits then the next question that we asked zela purchased and downloaded a book from the internet which cost 15 us dollar the exchange rate is one namibian dollar equals to zero point one one us how much did she pay for the book in namibian dollars so we can already tell that an increase in the namibian dollar is also will lead to an increase in the us dollar so here you just need to do the cross multiplication one dollar equals to zero point one one so fifteen dollar equals to what then this one is what we are asked we are asked to find so i've just denoted it with x such that then i'll do the cross multiplication i did the cross multiplication so it's going to be 15 times 1 equals 2 um 0.11 x and then i take i divide both sides with 0.11 so my x will then be able to find it as 136 points 36 dollar so if you have so if she bought the book for 15 years dollar that means in a million dollars is going to be 136 point 36 namibian dollars all right moving on to the next question the frequency of a wave is inversely to its wavelength so here we already know that this is an inversely proportional question for a wavelength of 150 meter the frequency is 2000 kilohertz calculate the length of the radio wave post frequency is 850 kilohertz so we know already that it is inversely proportional so we need to find the value of our constant which is k so if we say let our frequency be y and let our length be x right so such that the information that is provided to us the frequency is 2000 which is y and the length is 150 then our constant is going to be 3 million constant therefore now for me to find the value of x which is the length i just need to substitute where there is y i put 850 which is presented to me here and the constant is 3 million divided by x and the value of x is going to be 3000 divided by 850 which is 350 meters oh that was shot okay actually this was the last question on the proportion would you have any other question that you would want us to solve in the live session please don't hesitate to drop them by email send them to me via email at least 24 hours before the live session and then having said that you must check out on the next lesson portion or number and operation part four one
